Diabetes is one of the most deadly and chronic diseases which cause an increase in blood sugar. If diabetes remains untreated and unidentified many difficulties may arise due to that. The tedious work is in identifying the process which results in visiting the clinic and consulting the doctor. But this tedious work has been solved with the rise in the approaches used by machine learning. This project gives a comprehensive prospect of work accomplished to develop a model that can predict the possibility of diabetes in patients with extreme accuracy. Therefore, various machine learning classification algorithms namely genetic algorithm, decision tree, random forest, Logistic regression, SVM and Naive Bayes are used for detecting diabetes. Further we have done the comparison among various performances of all the different algorithms. The performances are categories of various measures like Precision, Accuracy, F-Measure and Recall. The project helps in identifying the algorithm to classify the risk of diabetes. Different techniques were applied to the algorithms for improving the robustness. Additionally, the findings suggest that the best performance of disease risk classification is done with the help of a genetic algorithm.
